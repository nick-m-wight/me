- Event-driven architectures with multi-system orchestration
- Legacy system modernization with cutting-edge tools

## 💼 Professional Background

**Software Engineer @ Multi-Billion Dollar Fintech** | 6+ years
- Built mission-critical payment processing integrations
- Architected real-time communication systems at scale
- Specialized in API development, webhooks, and system synchronization
- Led modernization initiatives bridging legacy and modern platforms

**Technical Foundation**
- Electronics Engineering degree with focus on digital systems

- Cross-disciplinary problem-solving: from circuit boards to distributed systems

## 🎯 Featured Projects

### 🔥 Enterprise Real-Time Communication Hub
**Unified multi-system communication platform serving 100,000+ users**

Built a real-time chat and telephony integration system that synchronized agent availability across LiveChat and RingCentral platforms. The system handled bidirectional state management - when an agent received a chat or call on either platform, their status instantly updated across both systems, preventing conflicts and ensuring optimal customer service.

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Backend:** Python with WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with dynamic state management and session handling
- **Template Engine:** Jinja2 for server-side rendering with pre/post-authentication flows
- **Integration Layer:** MuleSoft API orchestration + custom webhook handlers
- **Event-Driven:** Bidirectional webhooks for sub-second cross-system synchronization
- **Database:** Real-time state sync across multiple data sources

**Key Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Stateful session management for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Race condition handling in concurrent state updates
- Rate limiting and error recovery for high-traffic scenarios (100K+ concurrent users)
- Zero-downtime deployment to production with massive user base
- Production-grade monitoring and alerting

**Impact:** First company-wide chat system, seamless omnichannel experience, zero conflicts in agent availability

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `JavaScript` `Jinja` `MuleSoft` `WebSockets` `REST APIs` `Webhooks` `RingCentral API` `LiveChat API`

### 🤖 Claude-PowerOn Integration Bridge
**Bringing modern AI to legacy banking systems**

Building an integration layer that enables natural language interaction with Symitar PowerOn databases through Claude AI. This project bridges decades-old banking core systems with cutting-edge LLM technology, modernizing how financial institutions query data and generate reports.

**Technical Approach:**
- **AI Layer:** Claude API with prompt engineering for financial domain
- **Frontend/Integration:** JavaScript for API communication and response handling
- **Legacy Interface:** PowerOn scripting language and database access patterns
- **Middleware:** Translation layer between natural language and PowerOn commands
- **Security:** Enterprise-grade authentication and data access controls

**Planned Capabilities:**
- Natural language database queries → PowerOn script generation
- Automated report generation from conversational requests
- Intelligent data validation and anomaly detection
- Legacy code documentation and modernization assistance

**Why This Matters:** Financial institutions run on systems built 20-40 years ago. This integration unlocks modern AI capabilities while respecting the stability and security of proven legacy platforms.

**Status:** Active development  
**Tech Stack:** `JavaScript` `Claude API (Anthropic)` `Symitar PowerOn` `Banking Systems Integration`

## 💡 Beyond Code

**Systems Thinker & AI-Powered Problem Solver**

I bring the same engineering mindset to everything I do. As elected HOA President, I inherited a dysfunctional payment system (single check option, expensive mismanaged property manager). Here's how I approached it:

**The Process:**
1. **Research & Analysis:** Used Claude AI to help evaluate payment platform options, analyze vendor contracts, and create transition plans
2. **Rapid Implementation:** Implemented PayHOA digital payment platform in weeks
3. **Seamless Migration:** Transitioned all residents with zero billing disruption
4. **Financial Impact:** Eliminated property manager position, saving $18,000+ annually (22.5% of $80K budget)

**The Meta Story:** I used the same AI tools I'm integrating professionally (Claude) to solve a real-world organizational problem. This wasn't theoretical - it was AI-assisted decision-making under pressure with real financial stakes and community impact.

**Why mention this?** Because the skills that transformed an HOA are the same ones I bring to software engineering: rapid execution, AI-augmented analysis, stakeholder management, financial impact thinking, and systems modernization. Whether it's code or operations, I leverage modern tools to identify inefficiencies and deliver measurable results.

**Takeaway:** I don't just build AI integrations - I live and breathe the AI-native approach to problem-solving.
